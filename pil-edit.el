(defun get-selection-or-unit (unit)
  "Return the string and boundary of text selection or UNIT under cursor.

If `region-active-p' is true, then the region is the unit.  Else,
it depends on the UNIT. See `unit-at-cursor' for detail about
UNIT.

Returns a vector [text a b], where text is the string and a and b
are its boundary.

Example usage:
 (setq bds (get-selection-or-unit 'line))
 (setq inputstr (elt bds 0) p1 (elt bds 1) p2 (elt bds 2)  )"
  (interactive)

  (let ((p1 (region-beginning)) (p2 (region-end)))
    (if (region-active-p)
        (vector (buffer-substring-no-properties p1 p2) p1 p2 )
      (unit-at-cursor unit) ) ) )

;; This function get-selection-or-unit gets you the text selection if
;; there's one. If not, it calls unit-at-cursor. unit-at-cursor

(defun unit-at-cursor  (unit)
  "Return the string and boundary of UNIT under cursor.

Returns a vector [text a b], where text is the string and a and b are its boundary.

UNIT can be:
‚Ä¢ 'word ‚Äî sequence of 0 to 9, A to Z, a to z, and hyphen.
‚Ä¢ 'glyphs ‚Äî sequence of visible glyphs. Useful for file name, URL, ‚Ä¶, that doesn't have spaces in it.
‚Ä¢ 'line ‚Äî delimited by ‚Äú\\n‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ 'block ‚Äî delimited by ‚Äú\\n\\n‚Äù or beginning/end of buffer.
‚Ä¢ 'buffer ‚Äî whole buffer. (respects `narrow-to-region')
‚Ä¢ a vector [beginRegex endRegex] ‚Äî The elements are regex strings used to determine the beginning/end of boundary chars. They are passed to `skip-chars-backward' and `skip-chars-forward'. For example, if you want paren as delimiter, use [\"^(\" \"^)\"]

Example usage:
    (setq bds (unit-at-cursor 'line))
    (setq myText (elt bds 0) p1 (elt bds 1) p2 (elt bds 2)  )

This function is similar to `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
The main differences are:
‚Ä¢ this function returns the text and the 2 boundaries as a vector in one shot.
‚Ä¢ 'line always returns the line without end of line character, avoiding inconsistency when the line is at end of buffer.
‚Ä¢ 'word does not depend on syntax table.
‚Ä¢ 'block does not depend on syntax table."

;;     when you also need the boundary. 'line always returns the line
;;     without end of line character, avoiding inconsistency when the
;;     line is at end of buffer. 'word does not depend on syntax table.
;;     'block does not depend on syntax table of ‚Äúparagraph‚Äù. It's always
;;     delimited by 2 blank lines or beginning/end of file. 'glyphs is a
;;     sequence of visible glyphs. Useful for getting file path, URL, ‚Ä¶.
;;     A user defined boundary can be specified, by a vector [beginRegex
;;     endRegex]. It's passed to skip-chars-backward and
;;     skip-chars-forward. For example, if you want paren as delimiter,
;;     use ["^(" "^)"].
